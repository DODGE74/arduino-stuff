It turns out the Arduino 168 and 328 can measure their own voltage rail.

Code

Copy, paste into Arduino and see what it returns. This works on an Arduino 168 or 328.

``` long readVcc() { long result; // Read 1.1V reference against AVcc ADMUX = _BV(REFS0) | _BV(MUX3) | _BV(MUX2) | _BV(MUX1); delay(2); // Wait for Vref to settle ADCSRA |= _BV(ADSC); // Convert while (bit_is_set(ADCSRA,ADSC)); result = ADCL; result |= ADCH<<8; result = 1126400L / result; // Back-calculate AVcc in mV return result; }

void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); }

void loop() { Serial.println( readVcc(), DEC ); delay(1000); } ```

The voltage is returned in millivolts. So 5000 is 5V, 3300 is 3.3V.

Note the following: * This works on Arduinos with a 328 or 168 only. It looks like the same trick might be possible on the Arduino Mega - experiments are ongoing, and will be reported here.
